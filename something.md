Git Cheat Sheet

(1)  git init      : Tell git to start version controlling the files in a directory
                     (initialises git in a directory)
(2)  git status    : Tell git to print the status of the files in the version 
                     controlled directory.
(3)  git add       : Tell git to start monitoring (tracking) the versions of a new
                     file, e.g. `git add README.md` will tell git to track `README.md`   
(4)  git commit -a : Tell git to save a new snapshot version of all of the tracked
                     files in the directory. The `-a` means "all files". You can
                     commit new versions of individual files if you want, but this
                     is not recommended.
